Install the raspberry legacy os

This week our team set up the Raspberry Pi for the semester. We installed the required Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit), configured Wi-Fi and SSH, and updated the system. Python and required dependencies were installed and tested. Git was set up on the Pi, and each team member made a test commit to the group repository. The Raspberry Pi is now fully working and ready for future development and demos.

#need add documentation for cron files and thonny upload
